## Notes

- A `ClassCastException` usually occurs when we force cast one particular type to another non-related type. Ex. String to Button
- Another `ClassCastException` exception caused by the unsafe usage of the as operator.
- A `Resources.NotFoundException` occurs when a String resource can't be referenced (usually because it doesn't exist or we incorrectly referenced it).
- An `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` usually occurs when we try to access particular index in an array that doesn't exist. Ex. trying to access the 6th index in an array of size 5
- If you get the infamous `NullPointerException`, you know you definitely did something you shouldn't have.
